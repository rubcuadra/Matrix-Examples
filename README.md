# Matrix-Examples
A matrix with some helpful methods in C++

It was designed to implement Functions that use other functions as parameters
The Function Is Circular Prime it is pretty bad, it gives the first 999 circular primes but it can give till 9999

The whole methods are based to find the first number in the matrix with X attribute, for example the IsPrime,IsNegative, LowerThanX
or the first number that is that as well as the adyecent also has the same attribute

This example is good to practice Functions as Parameters
